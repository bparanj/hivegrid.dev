To manually verify that root login and password authentication are disabled on a server after running an Ansible playbook, you need to check the SSH daemon configuration file (`sshd_config`) on the server. Here's how to do it:

1. **SSH into the Server**: First, you need to SSH into the server where you want to verify the settings. Use a user account that has sudo privileges since you may need them to view or edit configuration files.

2. **Check the SSH Configuration**:
   - Open the SSH daemon configuration file located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with a text editor such as `nano` or `vim`. You might need `sudo` to access this file.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

3. **Verify Root Login is Disabled**:
   - Look for a line that specifies `PermitRootLogin`. The setting should be:
     ```
     PermitRootLogin no
     ```
   - This line ensures that root user cannot log in directly via SSH.

4. **Verify Password Authentication is Disabled**:
   - Search for the `PasswordAuthentication` setting. It should be set to:
     ```
     PasswordAuthentication no
     ```
   - This configuration disables password-based authentication, requiring users to use SSH keys or other forms of authentication.

5. **Check for Absence of Configurations**:
   - If you do not find these lines in the `sshd_config` file, they might be commented out (preceded by a `#`) or set to their default values. It's important to explicitly set them as shown above for clarity and security.
   - After making any changes, save the file and exit the text editor.

6. **Restart the SSH Service**:
   - If you had to make any changes to the `sshd_config` file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. You can do this with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart sshd
     ```
   - On some systems, the service might be named `ssh` instead of `sshd`, so adjust the command accordingly.

7. **Test the Configuration**:
   - To ensure your changes are effective, try to SSH into the server as the root user or using password authentication. Both attempts should fail.
   - Remember to use a non-root user with sudo privileges for these tests, to avoid being locked out of the server if your primary method of access was the configuration you just changed.

By following these steps, you can manually verify that root login and password authentication are disabled on your server, enhancing its security posture.

To check if a user has root privileges on an Ubuntu system, you can use several methods. Root privileges mean the user can execute commands with the highest access levels on the system, typically through `sudo` (superuser do) or by being the root user itself. Here are a few ways to check:

### 1. Checking Membership in the `sudo` or `admin` Groups

Users with root privileges are usually members of the `sudo` group (or `admin` group on some older versions of Ubuntu). You can check if the current user is part of the `sudo` group by running:

```bash
groups
```

Or specifically check for `sudo` or `admin` group membership:

```bash
groups | grep '\bsudo\b\|\badmin\b'
```

If the user is a member of these groups, they likely have root privileges.

### 2. Trying to Run a Command with `sudo`

Another straightforward method is to try running a command that requires root privileges with `sudo`. For example:

```bash
sudo ls /root
```

If the user can execute this command without an error, it indicates they have root privileges. If they don't, you'll see an error message stating the user is not in the sudoers file.

### 3. Checking the `/etc/sudoers` File

The `/etc/sudoers` file contains the rules that users must follow to use `sudo`. You can look at this file to see if a user is explicitly granted sudo privileges. Because this file should be carefully edited, it's best to view it with `visudo` or less:

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers
```
or
```bash
sudo less /etc/sudoers
```

Look for lines referring to specific users or groups. Be cautious not to modify anything unless you know what you're doing.

### 4. Using the `id` Command

You can use the `id` command to check a user's UID (User ID). The root user has a UID of 0.

For the current user:
```bash
id -u
```

If the output is `0`, the current user is root.

For another user, you can specify the username:
```bash
id -u username
```

Replace `username` with the name of the user you're checking. While this command shows if you're directly logged in as root, it won't necessarily indicate if a user can elevate privileges through `sudo`.

### Summary

The most common method to check for root privileges is by examining group membership and attempting to run a command with `sudo`. Itâ€™s important to understand that having the ability to run commands as root (via `sudo`) is essentially the same as having root privileges.

Based on the output you've provided, the user `ubuntu` is a member of several groups, including the `sudo` group. Membership in the `sudo` group means that this user has the ability to execute commands with root privileges by prefixing commands with `sudo`.

Being in the `sudo` group is what grants a user the ability to perform tasks that require higher privileges than a standard user. This is a common setup for administrative users on Ubuntu systems, allowing them to manage the system without logging in as the root user directly.

Therefore, the `ubuntu` user on your system has root privileges, as they can use `sudo` to run commands as the root user.

In the context of Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions, the `adm` group does not stand for "admin" in the sense of providing administrative privileges to perform most system administration tasks. Instead, the `adm` group is traditionally used to give certain users the ability to view and manage log files located in `/var/log` and other administrative files.

Members of the `adm` group are typically granted read access to many logs and system files for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. This is distinct from the `sudo` group, which is specifically intended to grant users the ability to execute commands as the root user, thereby providing full administrative privileges.

So, while the `adm` group does grant access to certain administrative files and logs, it does not confer the same level of system control that membership in the `sudo` group does.
