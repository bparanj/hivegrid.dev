To check if systemd services for Caddy, Redis, and PostgreSQL are set up and to assess their status, you can use the `systemctl` command. Here's how you do it for each service:

### Caddy

Check if the Caddy service is active and enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

This command gives you the current status of the Caddy service. If the service is enabled and running, it will show `active (running)` in the output.

### Redis

Check if the Redis service is active and enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis
```

This will show the status of the Redis service. Look for `active (running)` to confirm it is operational.

### PostgreSQL

Check if the PostgreSQL service is active and enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

The output will indicate whether PostgreSQL is running and enabled on your system.

### General Notes

- **Active (running)**: Indicates the service is currently running.
- **Enabled**: Means the service is set to start automatically at boot. You can check this by looking for the `Loaded` line in the `systemctl status` output. If it says `enabled`, it's configured to start at boot. If it says `disabled`, it will not start automatically.

To explicitly check if a service is enabled, you can use the `is-enabled` command, for example:

```bash
sudo systemctl is-enabled caddy
sudo systemctl is-enabled redis
sudo systemctl is-enabled postgresql
```

This command will return `enabled` if the service is set to start at boot or `disabled` if it isn't.

Remember, if any of the services are not running or are not enabled and you want them to be, you can start them with `sudo systemctl start <service_name>` and enable them with `sudo systemctl enable <service_name>`, respectively.
