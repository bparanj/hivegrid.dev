To check if Redis is installed and working from the terminal, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Check Redis Service Status**

First, check if the Redis service is running on your system. You can use the `systemctl` command on systems using `systemd`:

```sh
systemctl status redis
```

This command will show you the current status of the Redis service. If it's active and running, you're good to proceed. If not, you might need to start it using:

```sh
sudo systemctl start redis
```

### 2. **Connect to Redis Using the CLI**

Redis comes with a command-line interface (CLI) tool that you can use to interact directly with Redis. To check if Redis is working, you can connect to the Redis server using this tool:

```sh
redis-cli
```

Once connected, you can test if Redis is operational by setting a key and getting its value back:

```redis
set testkey "Hello, Redis!"
get testkey
```

If Redis is working correctly, the `get` command should return `"Hello, Redis!"`.

### 3. **Check Redis Version**

You can also check the installed version of Redis to ensure it's installed correctly. Run:

```sh
redis-server --version
```

This command will display the version of Redis installed on your system, indicating that Redis is indeed installed.

### 4. **Ping Redis**

Another quick way to check if Redis is operational is to use the `PING` command from the `redis-cli`:

```sh
redis-cli ping
```

If Redis is running, you should receive a response:

```
PONG
```

### 5. **Checking Redis Ports**

Lastly, you can check if Redis is listening on its default port (6379) or any other configured port using the `netstat` or `ss` command:

```sh
netstat -lnp | grep redis
# Or using `ss` if netstat is not available
ss -lnp | grep redis
```

This command will show if Redis is running and listening on the expected port.

These steps should help you verify if Redis is installed and working correctly from the terminal.

Your commands `netstat -lnp | grep redis` and `ss -lnp | grep redis` are intended to check if Redis is running and listening on a port, and, if so, on which port. However, the message "(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)" indicates that the command was run without sufficient privileges to see which process is associated with each open port.

### Using `sudo` for Full Visibility

To see the full output, including the process names and IDs, you should run these commands with `sudo`, which grants root privileges:

```bash
sudo netstat -lnp | grep redis
```

or 

```bash
sudo ss -lnp | grep redis
```

### Understanding the Commands

- **`netstat -lnp`**: 
  - `l` lists listening sockets.
  - `n` shows numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames.
  - `p` shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
- **`ss -lnp`**: Similar to `netstat`, but `ss` is often faster and provides more information. It's a utility to investigate sockets.
- **`| grep redis`**: This filters the output to show only lines that contain "redis", helping you quickly identify if Redis is running and listening on a port.

### Expected Output

If Redis is running and properly configured, you should see output indicating that Redis is listening on its default port (6379) or another configured port. The output will include the port number and possibly the Redis process ID, something like:

```plaintext
tcp   0  0 127.0.0.1:6379   0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN   [redis-pid]/redis-server
```

or for `ss`:

```plaintext
LISTEN  0  128  127.0.0.1:6379   0.0.0.0:*   users:(("redis-server",pid=redis-pid,fd=x))
```

### If You Don't See Redis in the Output

- **Redis might not be running**: Try starting Redis using your system's service manager (e.g., `sudo systemctl start redis` for systemd).
- **Redis might be configured to listen on a different port or interface**: Check Redis's configuration file, usually found at `/etc/redis/redis.conf`, for the `bind` and `port` directives.
- **Firewall or Security Group Settings**: Ensure that nothing is blocking the port Redis is configured to listen on.

Running these commands with `sudo` should give you a clear indication of whether Redis is active and listening for connections.
