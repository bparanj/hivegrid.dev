To list all running processes along with their port numbers, you can use the `ss` command combined with options and filtering through `grep`, or you can use the `netstat` command, though it may require installation on some newer distributions as it's considered deprecated in favor of `ss`. Here are examples using both:

### Using `ss`

The `ss` command is used to dump socket statistics and can show you all open ports and the processes that own them:

```bash
ss -ltnp
```

- `-l` shows listening sockets.
- `-t` shows TCP sockets.
- `-n` shows the port number.
- `-p` shows the process using the socket.

### Using `netstat`

If you have `netstat` installed (part of the `net-tools` package on many Linux distributions), you can use:

```bash
netstat -ltnp
```

The options are similar to `ss`:

- `-l` lists listening sockets.
- `-t` lists TCP connections.
- `-n` displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
- `-p` shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

### Note

- To use the `-p` option with either `ss` or `netstat`, you might need to run the command with `sudo` to see the process names for all users, like so: `sudo ss -ltnp` or `sudo netstat -ltnp`.
- The output will list the protocol, port number, state of the socket, and the process ID (PID) along with the process name that's listening on each port.
