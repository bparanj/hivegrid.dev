## Purpose

This document is used to check the packages installed on the target machine.

## Why Manual Steps

These steps are manual because the alternative way provides a way to check if the automated tools have done the job correctly. This is a fallback option.

## Steps

### Create the Input File

Save the name of the packages to check in packages.txt file.

Python code to extract the package names from the Ansible playbook. See playbooks/extract.py.

Create the check.sh script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Color codes
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # Reset to normal

# Check if a filename is provided
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide the filename containing the package list."
    exit 1
fi

# Read the package list file
package_file="$1"

# Ensure the file exists and is readable
if [[ ! -r "$package_file" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Cannot read package list file: $package_file"
    exit 1
fi

# Iterate over packages in the file
while read -r package; do
  if dpkg-query -W -f='${Status}' "$package" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "ok installed"; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}$package is installed${NC}"
  else
    echo -e "${RED}$package is not installed${NC}"
  fi
done < "$package_file"
```

Provide execute permission:

```
chmod 744 check.sh
```

Run the shell script to verify the package installation:

```
./check.sh packages.txt
```

Delete the packages.txt and check.sh after verification.
