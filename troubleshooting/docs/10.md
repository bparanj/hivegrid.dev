On Mac:

```
aws ec2 describe-addresses --allocation-ids eipalloc-057fe4dc2631b26e3 --region us-west-2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/aws", line 19, in <module>
    import awscli.clidriver
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'awscli'
```

The error message indicates that the AWS CLI is not correctly installed or its installation is corrupted. The Python environment cannot find the `awscli` module, which is required for the AWS CLI to function.

Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Install AWS CLI**:

```bash
brew install awscli
```

This does not work. Follow the instructions: [User guide for vesion 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```
$ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.15.28 Python/3.11.8 Darwin/23.1.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

2. **Verify Installation**: After reinstalling, verify that the AWS CLI is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```

   This command should return the version of the AWS CLI installed on your system.

3. **Retry the Command**: Once you've confirmed the AWS CLI is installed correctly, try running your command again:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-addresses --allocation-ids eipalloc-057fe4dc2631b26e3 --region us-west-2
   ```
