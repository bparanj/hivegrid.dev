To view all services running on an Ubuntu system, including Redis, PostgreSQL, and Caddy, you can use the `systemctl` command, which interacts with the systemd system and service manager. This command allows you to list all services that systemd knows about, showing their current status.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **List All Services**: To see every service recognized by systemd, whether active or not, run:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service
   ```
   This command lists all units of the type "service", showing their status (active, inactive, or failed), alongside a brief description.

2. **Filter for Active Services**: If you're only interested in services that are currently running (active), you can refine the command as follows:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
   ```
   This modification lists only services that are in a "running" state.

3. **Check Specific Services**: To check the status of a specific service, such as Redis, PostgreSQL, or Caddy, you can use the `systemctl status` command followed by the service name. For example:
   - For Redis:
     ```bash
     systemctl status redis.service
     ```
   - For PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     systemctl status postgresql.service
     ```
     Note: The exact service name can vary depending on how PostgreSQL was installed (e.g., `postgresql@12-main.service`). Adjust the command accordingly.
   - For Caddy:
     ```bash
     systemctl status caddy.service
     ```
     Again, ensure you're using the correct service name as it may vary based on installation details.

4. **Using grep to Filter**: If you have a lot of services and want to quickly check if your specific services (like Redis, PostgreSQL, Caddy) are running, you can pipe the `systemctl` output to `grep`:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running | grep -E '(redis|postgresql|caddy)'
   ```
   This command will filter the list, showing only lines that contain "redis", "postgresql", or "caddy".

These methods should help you effectively monitor the services running on your Ubuntu system, providing a clear view of the status of Redis, PostgreSQL, Caddy, and any other services you're interested in.
