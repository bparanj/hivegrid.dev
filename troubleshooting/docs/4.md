## Verify Postgresql Installation

Verifying a PostgreSQL installation involves several checks to ensure that the service is running correctly and that you can connect to the database server. Here are the steps you can follow to verify your PostgreSQL installation:

### 1. **Check the PostgreSQL Service Status**

First, check if the PostgreSQL service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

This command will show the current status of the PostgreSQL service. You're looking for an active (running) status.

### 2. **Connect to the PostgreSQL Database**

Try connecting to the PostgreSQL database using the `psql` command-line interface. If you installed PostgreSQL with the default settings, you can try to connect as the `postgres` user (the default administrative user):

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

This command opens the PostgreSQL prompt, from which you can run SQL commands. If you're able to enter the PostgreSQL prompt, it's a good indication that the installation was successful.

When you use the command `sudo -u postgres psql`, you are accessing the PostgreSQL database command line interface (`psql`) as the `postgres` user. This is a special user account created by PostgreSQL during installation for database administration purposes.

### User

- **User**: `postgres`
  - This is the default administrative user in PostgreSQL.

### Password

- **Password**: By default, when you use `sudo -u postgres psql`, you are not required to enter a password. This is because this command switches your current Linux user to `postgres` and then accesses the database, bypassing the need for PostgreSQL password authentication. This method relies on "peer" authentication (for Unix domain socket connections), as configured in the `pg_hba.conf` file for the `postgres` user, allowing system users to log in to the PostgreSQL roles that match their Unix/Linux username without a password.

### Default Database

When you connect to PostgreSQL using `psql` without specifying a database, `psql` will attempt to connect to a default database that has the same name as the current user. Since you're using `sudo -u postgres psql`, it tries to connect to the `postgres` database by default.

- **Default Database**: `postgres`
  - This is a default database created during the PostgreSQL installation, intended for users, maintenance, and DBA work, rather than application data. It's common to use this database for administrative tasks.

### Summary

- Using `sudo -u postgres psql` logs you into the PostgreSQL database server as the `postgres` user, typically without requiring a password due to peer authentication.
- The default database that `psql` connects to with this command is also named `postgres`.

This behavior is part of PostgreSQL's security model, designed to tightly integrate with the security model of the Unix-like operating systems. If you need to perform operations as the `postgres` user from a remote machine or without using `sudo`, you would typically need to set up password authentication or another method supported by PostgreSQL and configure it in `pg_hba.conf`.

The command `sudo -u postgres psql` is subtly different from `sudo -h localhost -u postgres psql`, primarily because of the `-h` option's presence or absence and its meaning in different contexts. Let's break down both commands:

### `sudo -u postgres psql`

- **`sudo`**: Run the following command with superuser or another user's privileges.
- **`-u postgres`**: Specifies that the command should be run as the `postgres` user.
- **`psql`**: The command to be run, in this case, the PostgreSQL command-line interface.

This command switches to the `postgres` system user and then executes `psql`, connecting to the PostgreSQL server. The connection is made through a Unix socket by default, not TCP/IP, and it typically relies on peer authentication configured in PostgreSQL's `pg_hba.conf` file for local connections.

### `sudo -h localhost -u postgres psql`

Here, it seems there's a mix-up in the command options. The `-h` option is actually a `psql` option to specify the hostname of the database server to connect to, and it's not a `sudo` option. The correct usage intending to specify the hostname for the `psql` command would look like this:

- `sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost`

Breaking down this corrected command:

- **`sudo -u postgres`**: Run the command as the `postgres` user.
- **`psql`**: Invoke the PostgreSQL command-line interface.
- **`-h localhost`**: Tells `psql` to connect to the PostgreSQL server using TCP/IP on `localhost` rather than a Unix socket.

### Key Differences

- **Connection Method**: The main difference is in the intended method of connecting to the PostgreSQL server:
  - Without `-h localhost`, `psql` connects through a Unix domain socket.
  - With `-h localhost`, `psql` attempts to connect via TCP/IP to the PostgreSQL server running on `localhost`.
- **Authentication**: Depending on the `pg_hba.conf` configuration, the authentication method could differ between Unix socket connections and localhost TCP/IP connections. For example, peer authentication might be configured for Unix socket connections, while password or md5 might be required for TCP/IP connections.

### Summary

- `sudo -u postgres psql` is the correct way to switch to the `postgres` user and start the `psql` shell, typically connecting through a Unix socket.
- To explicitly connect to `localhost` using TCP/IP, the correct command is `sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost`. This form is useful if you need to test or enforce TCP/IP connectivity, possibly with different authentication methods as defined in your `pg_hba.conf` file.

### 3. **Check Installed PostgreSQL Version**

While connected to the PostgreSQL prompt, you can check the version of PostgreSQL that's installed:

```sql
SELECT version();
```

This SQL command will display the PostgreSQL version along with some system information, confirming that PostgreSQL is indeed running and can execute queries.

### 4. **List the Available Databases**

Still within the `psql` interface, you can list the databases to ensure the default databases are present:

```sql
\l
```

This command lists all databases. You should see the `postgres` database among others, which is the default database.

### 5. **Exit the `psql` Interface**

After your checks, you can exit the `psql` interface by typing:

```sql
\q
```

### Additional Checks

- **Check for Listening Ports**: Verify that PostgreSQL is listening on the default port (5432) or another configured port:

  ```bash
  sudo ss -tuln | grep 5432
  ```

  This command checks for services listening on port 5432. Replace `5432` with your configured port if you've customized it.

- **Review PostgreSQL Logs**: PostgreSQL logs can provide insights into the database server's operations and any errors that might have occurred. The location of these logs varies depending on how PostgreSQL was installed and your operating system, but a common location is `/var/log/postgresql/`. Reviewing the logs can help verify that the system is operating without critical errors.

  ```bash
  sudo less /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-XX-main.log
  ```

  Replace `XX` with the version number of PostgreSQL you've installed.

Successfully completing these steps without encountering errors indicates that your PostgreSQL installation is likely configured correctly and operational.

Accessible only from localhost:

```
grep listen_addresses /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf
```

Output:

```
listen_addresses = 'localhost'
```

Allow local connections only:

```
sudo grep "local\s*all\s*all\s*peer" /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
```

Use temporary database user to check database connection:

```
psql -h localhost -U dbtester -d postgres
```

From a different EC2 instance run:

```
psql -h <EC2-instance-public-IP> -U dbtester -d postgres
```
