Ah, the rollercoaster of deploying Rails apps, a saga spanning over 15 wild years.

Flashback to 2007, I was all in with Moonshine, Puppet, and Capistrano. They did the job, but oh boy, the way they clung to the Rails codebase like overzealous party guests? Not ideal. Puppet? More like trying to navigate a maze with clown shoes on. And the mess of files from different tools felt like a yard sale gone wrong.

Fast forward, and I’m knee-deep in Chef and Puppet recipes, juggling updates for work and my side hustles. It was a slog. Database backups? MIA. Manually setting up servers felt like being stuck in the mud, and GUIs had me gnashing my teeth. Don’t even get me started on the SSL escapades. Constant. Struggle.

Enter Docker, strutting onto the scene, demanding I learn new tricks. I remember sitting in a Chef workshop in San Francisco in 2014, scratching my head, feeling like I was reading hieroglyphs without the Rosetta Stone. The whole infrastructure as code (IaC) thing? A mystery wrapped in an enigma.

Bouncing around startups and finance joints, I found myself forever starting from scratch with Rails deployments. IaC tools? Nowhere in sight.

So, why this website? It’s my way of dropping hard-earned wisdom. I’ve felt the pain, tripped over the pitfalls, and now, I’m here to hand you a map through the minefield. My mission? To save your sanity and make deploying Rails apps a breeze.

Here’s the kicker: I’m crafting a product steeped in IaC tools, despite being a greenhorn in using them professionally. Why? Because I’m all about building with empathy. I’m aiming to hatch something that gets the developer struggle, that smooths out the bumps I—and probably you—have hit along the way.

I’m all ears for your tales from the Rails deployment trenches. Hit similar snags? I’ve got your back. Shoot me your stories. Let’s navigate this jungle together.
